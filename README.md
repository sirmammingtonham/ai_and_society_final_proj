# FakeBlock
Proof of concept Google Chrome extension that blocks deepfakes.

## Installation:
Clone this repository, then run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

Once installed, run ```python detect.py``` locally, then in a chrome browser that allows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), load the plugin folder as an extension.

## Usage:
Go to a website with possible deepfakes and click on the extension icon. FakeBlock will check possible deepfakes and AI generated content through a neural network and automatically block them for you.

Check the demo video for more info.
